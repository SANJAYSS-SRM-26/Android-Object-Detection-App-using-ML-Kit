# Android-Object-Detection-App-using-ML-Kit
  This repository contains the source code for an Android application that leverages Google's ML Kit for object detection. 
  The app allows users to capture images through the device's camera or choose from sample images. Once an image is selected, ML Kit processes the image and detects objects within it, drawing bounding boxes around the         identified objects along with their classification and confidence levels.

# Key Features:
  Capture images using the device's camera.
  Choose from sample images for object detection.
  Utilizes Google ML Kit for object detection and classification.
  Displays bounding boxes around detected objects with associated labels and confidence levels.
  Provides a user-friendly interface with sample images and a camera capture button.

# How to Use:
  Capture Image: Click on the camera icon to launch the device's camera and capture an image for object detection.
  Select Sample Image: Choose from the available sample images to perform object detection.
  Object Detection Result: View the processed image with bounding boxes around detected objects, displaying their labels and confidence levels.

# Dependencies:
  Google ML Kit Vision Library
  AndroidX Libraries
  ExifInterface for image orientation correction

# Note: 
  Ensure that appropriate permissions for camera usage are granted on the device.
